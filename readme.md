#Git Fundamentals

Git is a version control system that allows us to track changes and commit them to history.

Here is a growing collection of resources and helpful command to know when working with git.

- [git add](./commands/Add.md)
- [git clone](./commands/Clone.md)
- [git commit](./commands/Commit.md)
- [git config](./commands/Config.md)
- [git init](./commands/Init.md)
- [git push](./commands/Push.md)
- [git pull](./commands/Pull.md)
- [git remote](./commands/Remote.md)
- [git status](./commands/Status.md)

# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updated from the original repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
